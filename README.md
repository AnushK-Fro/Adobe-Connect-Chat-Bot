'How do I use this?'
'Simply start the project. Then, go to your adobe connect session and increase the text size to "24" (what I found worked best)
'and then drag the window to the chat and make sure you can see the chat through the transparent box.
'Then, set the trigger and response. For example, if you want someone to say bpizza and then you to respond automatically, put the trigger as
'bpizza and put the response as whatever you want the bot to respond as

'Support for this bot has sadly ended, but I may update it at times.'
'This bot is made in VB.NET which I hate, but I didn't know how to make an OCR engine in C#'
