Adobe Connect Chat Bot

This is a free, open source chat bot that utilizes OCR to pick up chat messages.
To use this, put a word as a trigger and whatever you want the bot to respond. 
Whenever someone types the word you put as a trigger, the bot will automatically pick it up and respond to what you set.

The chat size should be set to 24. This program is not perfect and I am no longer updating this program.

Update: This will probably be rewritten in another language
